Love Tropics is a weekend-long charity livestream ran by the Tropicraft Dev Team and the Tropibros, focused on raising funds to help rebuild Puerto Rico.

In 2017 we raised US$10,155 for Direct Relief to help with medical supplies and aid, and in 2018 we raised US$35,255.46 for Team Rubicon to help put roofs back onto houses.
In 2019 we managed to raise US$63,063 for Cool Earth to help prevent deforestation in Papua New Guinea.
